# C-FileManager
This File Manager CLI Tool was developed by Tamim, Sabbir for our CSE323: Operating Systems course. It showcases our understanding of OS concepts by implementing file operations like copy, move, rename, and create using C. This project bridges theory and practice, applying OS fundamentals in a practical, user-friendly tool.
